Settings Sync lets you share your Visual Studio Code configurations such as settings, keybindings, and installed extensions across your machines so you are always working with your favorite setup.


## Config
Settings Sync Configuration page will be opened automatically on code start and requires two things to setup:

- GitHub Token
- GitHub Gist Id
GitHub Token needs to be retrived by your GitHub account while Settings Sync creates GIST if you are first time user.

### Following are the steps you need to perform to configure.

[1. Click on Login with GitHub]
